# httpclient

httpclient is a rich implementation of the concepts provided in the talk "Embrace the Interface" by Tomas Senart.

## why

Because I implemented this in too many projects, and I want a go-to implementation that works out of the box.

## what does it do

httpclient is a composable client that is compatible with the `http.Client` from the Go stdlib, but is a whole lot more composable.
